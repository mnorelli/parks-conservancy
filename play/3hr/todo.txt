1. create a grid over the bay area in qgis
2. get centroids of each cell
3. output this as geojson
4. read grid centroids in python, with parks locations
5. for each GC, create a googz distance matrix REST call where origins=centroid, destinations=38 parks locations
6. get the distance data, cache it so we never have to do this again
7. create contours based on near-similar distances...
   7a. when a user selects their location-grid on the frontend
   7b. load the json file that contains distances to all parks
   7c. group the near-similar points
   7d. d3.hull() each group of near-similar points
8. beer
