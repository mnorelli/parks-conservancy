git clone https://github.com/shawnbot/d3-to-png


the chain:
1. node process_trips.js  (NOTE: this requires a list of trip ids. how do we get this?)
2. node create_index.js
3. node d3-to-png/index.js --trip $trip ../svg_trail_paths.js > svg/$trip.svg
 
sometimes #3 fails because imagemagick hangs. i have no idea why.
